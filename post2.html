<p>The 2024 general election is going to be an important event for two reasons. First, the outcome of this electoral battle will decide the political destiny of two powerful coalitions – BJP-led NDA and Congress dominated INDIA bloc. BJP has so far relied heavily on Modi. It will be interesting to observe how this Modicentric campaign helps the party retain its electoral hegemony.On the other hand, Opposition, especially Congress, has been successful so far in establishing itself as a serious challenger. This is certainly a new development. BJP’s electoral success has played a significant role in the political marginalisation of Opposition in the last 10 years. This time, however, Opposition is much more active in pursuing an aggressive electoral campaign. This aggressive politics will certainly have an impact on the electoral outcome.</p>
